### What is Machine Learning?

> Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without axplicitely programmed.
Arthur Samuel (1959)

## Supervised Learning

This is the type that you give the machine to learn from “the right answers”.  Supervised Learning learn from  data labeled with “right answer”

- Spam Filtering
- Speech Recognition
- Machine Translation
- Online Advertising
- Self-Driving Car
- Visual Inspection

→**Regression** is a method of Supervised Learning

- Estimating rental prices for houses from a given sample of houses and price pairs

### Regression Models

1. **Lineer Regression**:
   We have _feature_ variable and _target_ variable

→ **Classification** is another method for Supervised Learning

- Classification predict categories (classes) like in,
    - cat-dog distinction,
    - malignant-benign
    - 0,1,2… (finite number)
- This is different from Regression because its output has small number

## Unsupervised Learning

In this type of data we are not given any answers. We try to find something interesting in the given data.

- Used in Google News

→Clustering is a method of Unsupervised Learning

- DNA Clustering
- Customer Clustering

→ Anomaly Detection

- Fraud Detection in financial system
